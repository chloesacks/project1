For this project, I wanted to use photos and other content that would be conducive to the project requirements. Recipes seemed like one that would allow me to incorporate photos, lists, and so on, and I was inspired by a friend who posts the most amazing looking cocktail tableaus on her private Instagram. So, I borrowed her images, the link to her (almost never used) public Instagram account, and the account name with her permission. I've always thought that she could create a book or something of her photos and recipes, so I thought it would be fun to play with it for a simple website.
